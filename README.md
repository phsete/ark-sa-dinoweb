# ARK Survival Ascended Dinoweb
This tool has the goal of exporting the relevant stats for breeding directly out of the server save game file.

## Current Status
* Export of Rex Data seems successfull (reproducable by executing `get_all.py`)
    * Outputs info of all tamed dinos to `output/server_info.json`
 
## Disclaimer
ARK Survival Ascended is a game from Studio Wildcard and this project has no connection to them in any way.
